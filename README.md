# Hagiwo-8-Drum-Sample-playback-with-MIDI and DAC

Modified version of the Hagiwo $8 Drum Sample playback module.

https://note.com/solder_state/n/n950ed088c3cb

Converted to RP2040 as the ESP32-C3 does not work well with i2s DACs

Using the YD-RP2040 16Mb version it should be possible to increase the amount of drum samples to nearly 200 or increase the sample length for longer samples and reduce the amount around 100 samples per drum.

Reads MIDI CC messages and program changes on channel 1 for control over the sample number, tuning and filter.

* CC 08 controls the tuning of the drum in 128 steps.
* CC 09 controls the volume, CC07 was a problem for some reason.
* CC 10 controls the panning let to right.
* PGM change 0-47 select the sample to playback and triggers the sound.
* MIDI note on to trigger drum has to be fixed per unit.
* LED indicator for 48khz sample speed

I moved the trigger input to another pin.
